# Introduction of Jupyter Notebooks for Physicists
This Repository is created to supply Physics students with introductory Jupyter Notebooks to learn coding in Python for physics projects. This repository only contains introductional material and some general tools that are not specific to some domain of physics. Other repositories are set-up for domain-specific purposes.
##### Content
Jupyter Notebooks are very versatile in the support of coding of physicst problems. Not only to solve problems, but also to learn concepts of physics. 

List of the available notebooks:
1. Introduction to Jupyter Notebooks
2. Complex Number Gymnastics
3. Non-linear fit example
4. Function-fit notebook with prompt for data file
